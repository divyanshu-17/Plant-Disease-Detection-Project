# üåø Plant Disease Detection System

A deep learning-based web application to detect diseases in plant leaves. This project leverages the **Plant Village Dataset** and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained using **TensorFlow/Keras**. The system provides accurate disease predictions through a clean, user-friendly interface built using **Streamlit**.

## üìÇ Dataset

We used the **Plant Village Dataset** for training, which includes thousands of images across multiple crop types and diseases.

- üß¨ 38 classes (healthy + diseased plant leaves)
- üñºÔ∏è 50,000+ labeled images
